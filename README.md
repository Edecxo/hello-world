# hello-world

"A little bit about myself"?
I'm a cybersecurity student just trying to learn how to program.
I feel pretty confident with the basics of Python and Java, but now just have to make something with them.

I'm hoping that after a little while I can begin adding some functionality to some 
  libraries I like, and contribute to the community.
